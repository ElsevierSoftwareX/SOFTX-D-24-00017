# Feynman-Hibbs Corrected Mie Pair Potential for LAMMPS

This repository contains an extension for the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) that implements a Feynman-Hibbs corrected Mie pair potential.
The two new pair style files are located at EXTRA-PAIR folder.
This extension should work with different version of LAMMPS. However, we include the source code of LAMMPS stable 2022 here.
